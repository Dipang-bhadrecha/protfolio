                <p>Imagine you're a business owner looking to hire a team of 7 employees.
                    To secure their interest, you offer a signing bonus, but there's a risk:
                    these same employees might be collecting signing bonuses from multiple businesses across different locations,
                    with no intention of actually joining any of them. This leaves you and other business owners at a financial loss.</p>
